.Dt KSQL_ALLOC 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ksql_alloc
.Nd allocate a ksql database handle
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb ksql
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdint.h
.In ksql.h
.Ft struct ksql *
.Fo ksql_alloc
.Fa "const struct ksqlcfg *cfg"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function creates a SQLite database handle.
This must be matched by a call to
.Xr ksql_free 3
unless
.Dv KSQL_SAFE_EXIT
is specified, in which case it will be freed on exit.
(It is still good practise to manually free.)
It is usually followed by
.Xr ksql_open 3 .
The database is opened within the calling process.
For a split-process model, see
.Xr ksql_alloc_child 3 .
.Pp
If
.Fa cfg
is
.Dv NULL ,
a configuration from
.Xr ksql_cfg_defaults 3
is used.
.\" .Sh CONTEXT
.\" For section 9 functions only.
.\" .Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.\" Not used in OpenBSD.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
This returns the allocated database handle or
.Dv NULL
if memory allocations failed.
.\" For sections 2, 3, and 9 function return values only.
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\" For sections 1, 6, 7, and 8 only.
