.Dt KSQL_ALLOC_CHILD 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ksql_alloc_child
.Nd allocate a ksql database handle in split-process mode
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb ksql
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdint.h
.In ksql.h
.Ft struct ksql *
.Fo ksql_alloc_child
.Fa "const struct ksqlcfg *cfg"
.Fa "void (*onfork)(void *arg)"
.Fa "void *arg"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function creates a SQLite database handle.
It must be matched by a call to
.Xr ksql_free 3
unless
.Dv KSQL_SAFE_EXIT
is specified, in which case it will be freed on exit.
(It is still good practise to manually free.)
It is usually followed by
.Xr ksql_open 3 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
function differs from
.Xr ksql_alloc 3
in that the database is opened in a child process instead of within the
current process, with all database queries running over a communication
socket.
This way, the caller can safely sandbox after the function returns.
.Pp
If
.Fa cfg
is
.Dv NULL ,
a configuration from
.Xr ksql_cfg_defaults 3
is used.
.Pp
The
.Fa onfork
function, if specified, is invoked by the child after a successful
.Xr fork 2
with the
.Fa arg
variable.
The process environment within which
.Fa onfork
is invoked is prior to its being sandboxed.
.\" .Sh CONTEXT
.\" For section 9 functions only.
.\" .Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.\" Not used in OpenBSD.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
This returns the allocated database handle or
.Dv NULL
if memory allocations failed.
.\" For sections 2, 3, and 9 function return values only.

.\" For sections 1, 6, 7, and 8 only.
