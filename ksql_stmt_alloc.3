.Dt KSQL_STMT_ALLOC 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ksql_stmt_alloc
.Nd allocate a statement on a database connection
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb ksql
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdint.h
.In ksql.h
.Ft enum ksqlc
.Fo ksql_stmt_alloc
.Fa "struct ksql *sql"
.Fa "struct ksqlstmt **stmt"
.Fa "const char *sqlstmt"
.Fa "size_t id"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function allocates a SQL statement
.Fa sqlstmt
on a database connection
.Fa sql
previously opened with
.Xr ksql_open 3 .
It must be matched by a call to
.Xr ksql_stmt_free 3 .
Upon success, this will fill in the
.Fa stmt
pointer.
The
.Fa id
is used to identify the statement in error messages and should uniquely
identify the statement. 
.Pp
If a non-empty
.Fa cfg->stmts
structure documented in
.Xr ksql_cfg_defaults 3
is passed to
.Xr ksql_alloc 3
or
.Xr ksql_alloc_child 3 ,
the stored statement is looked up by
.Fa id
and the
.Fa sql
value is ignored.
If
.Fa id
is not a valid index of
.Fa cfg->stmts.stmtsz ,
the program is immediately terminated.
.Pp
The
.Nm
function handles a locked database (specifically,
.Dv SQLITE_BUSY ,
.Dv SQLITE_LOCKED ,
or
.Dv SQLITE_PROTOCOL )
by sleeping for a random interval, then trying again infinitely.
.\" .Sh CONTEXT
.\" For section 9 functions only.
.\" .Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.\" Not used in OpenBSD.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
This returns
.Dv KSQL_MEM
on allocation failure,
.Dv KSQL_NOTOPEN
if the database isn't connected, or
.Dv KSQL_DB
if there were errors invoking
.Xr sqlite3_prepare_v2 3 ,
otherwise
.Dv KSQL_OK
on success.
.\" For sections 2, 3, and 9 function return values only.
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\" For sections 1, 6, 7, and 8 only.
.\" .Sh FILES
