.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm ksql_stmt_step
and
.Nm ksql_stmt_cstep
functions query the next results of a statement opened with
.Xr ksql_stmt_open 3 .
The two functions differ in that
.Nm ksql_stmt_cstep
allows constraint conditions not to return as errors.
.Pp
These functions handles a locked database (specifically,
.Dv SQLITE_BUSY ,
.Dv SQLITE_LOCKED ,
or
.Dv SQLITE_PROTOCOL )
by sleeping for a random interval, then trying again infinitely.
.\" .Sh CONTEXT
.\" For section 9 functions only.
.\" .Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.\" Not used in OpenBSD.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return
.Dv KSQL_NOTOPEN
if the database connection has not been opeend,
.Dv KSQL_ROW
if a row is available for examining,
.Dv KSQL_DONE
if no more rows are available,
.Dv KSQL_CONSTRAINT
if
.Nm ksql_stmt_cstep
was used and a constraint was violated,
.Dv KSQL_DB
on database errors (including constraints, if those are not explicitly
alllowed), or
.Dv KSQL_OK
otherwise.
.\" For sections 2, 3, and 9 function return values only.
